Jive Snippets - Nathaniel Elliott
=========

https://community.jivesoftware.com/groups/theme-development

There are a few tools that I use on a regular basis for editing / working with Jive and it's themes. My team will slowly fill this out with all the things that we find useful. At the same time, we will try to explain how we use them: 

* jive-htmlwidget.html - What Jive uses on their own personal site's homepage, a starter point for all HTML styled things that we do.
* jive-themesearch.txt - How we search out what theme files we need to change, edit, modify. As well, we use this to see how things work together. **Command + F** is amazing!
* jive-htmlsidebar.html - How does the sidebar work on the right of the homepage of Jive.
